# /salvage

Extract learning from work before restarting. **Code is cheap; learning is the asset.**

## When to Use

Invoke `/salvage` when:

- **Work is drifting** - approach has changed direction multiple times
- **Scope expanding while "done" keeps fuzzing** - the finish line keeps moving
- **Starting over feels right** - but you don't want to lose what you learned

**Do not use when:** Work is on track and converging. Salvage is for extraction before restart, not routine reflection.

## The Salvage Process

### Step 1: Acknowledge the State

> "This session/approach is being salvaged because [reason]. The original aim was [aim]. What happened was [reality]."

### Step 2: Extract Five Things

Work through these categories. Extract what's present.

**If RNA MCP is available:** Before extracting, call `oh_search_context` with the failure domain and active phase. Was this failure predictable from the corpus? Three outcomes change what gets written:

- **Relevant entry existed and applied** — the learning is about process (corpus not consulted), not domain. Write process metis, not domain metis.
- **Relevant entry existed but was insufficient** — update or strengthen existing entries rather than creating near-duplicates.
- **Nothing found** — new territory. Write fresh metis with confidence.

#### 1. Model Shifts (What changed your understanding?)

- What assumptions were wrong?
- What would you tell yourself at the start of this work?

> "I thought X, but Y."

#### 2. Guardrails (Constraints discovered the hard way)

- What boundaries should have been explicit from the start?
- What "don't do this" rules emerged?
- What edge cases bit you?

Format as explicit constraints:
```
Guardrail: [boundary]
Reason: [why this matters]
Trigger: [when to revisit this constraint]
```

#### 3. Missing Context (What would have helped upfront?)

- What questions should have been asked at the start?
- What existing code/patterns should have been found first?

> "If I had known about [X], I would have [Y] instead."

#### 4. Local Practices (Hard-won lessons worth encoding)

Good local practices are:
- Specific enough to be actionable, general enough to apply beyond this case
- Non-obvious (not "write tests" but "this API silently returns 200 on auth failure")
- Situated and decision-changing, not generic advice a foundation model already knows

#### 5. What Worked (Don't lose the wins)

- What approaches or code fragments are worth keeping?
- What partial solutions could seed the restart?

### Step 3: Package for Fresh Start

Synthesize the extraction into a restart kit:

```markdown
## Salvage Summary

### Original Aim
[What we were trying to achieve]

### Why Salvaged
[Direct statement of what went wrong]

### Key Learnings
1. [Learning 1]
2. [Learning 2]
3. [Learning 3]

### New Guardrails
- [Guardrail 1]
- [Guardrail 2]

### Context for Restart
[What the next attempt should know before starting]

### Reusable Fragments
[Any code, patterns, or approaches worth keeping]
```

### Step 4: Persist Learnings (if available)

Persist the metis, not the noise. Record the non-obvious constraints, anomalies, trade-offs, and local patterns that would change a later decision. Generic best-practice advice that adds no local leverage should be left out of the artifact.

If Open Horizons MCP is available:
1. **Log to OH** — Log tribal knowledge and guardrails to the graph
2. **Update AGENTS.md** — If learnings are project-wide, suggest additions
3. **Record to RNA** (if available) — `oh_record_metis` for new learnings (no duplicates), `oh_record_guardrail_candidate` for hard constraints, `outcome_progress` to record what was accomplished before restarting

If no persistent storage is available, output the salvage summary for the user to capture manually.

**Meta-signal:** If salvage repeatedly surfaces similar learnings, the corpus has the knowledge but it’s not being consulted. That pattern warrants `/distill`.

## Output Format

Always produce a salvage summary in this structure:

```
## Salvage Report

**Salvaged:** [date/session identifier]
**Reason:** [why this work is being salvaged]
**Original Aim:** [what we were trying to do]

### Learnings
[Numbered list of key insights]

### New Guardrails
[Explicit constraints with reason and trigger]

### Missing Context
[What would have helped]

### Local Practices
[Hard-won wisdom to encode]

### Reusable Fragments
[Code or patterns worth keeping]

### Fresh Start Recommendation
[How to approach this next time]
```

## Session Persistence

**Reads:** Everything — Aim, Problem Statement, Problem Space, Solution Space, Execute, Review — to understand what was attempted and what happened.

**Writes:** Salvage report seeding the next session:

```markdown
## Salvage
**Updated:** <timestamp>
**Outcome:** [extracted learnings, ready for restart]

[salvage report: learnings, guardrails, context for fresh start]
```

## Position in Framework

**Comes after:** `/review` (drift detected) or `/execute` (thrashing recognized).
**Leads to:** `/aim` or `/problem-space` with fresh understanding.
