# /execute

Bridge from Solution Space to shipped code. Pre-flight, build, detect drift, salvage if needed.

Execute sits within **Intent → Execution → Review**. It contains an inner loop: build, check alignment, course-correct or salvage.

## When to Use

Invoke `/execute` when aim is clear, solution is chosen, context is loaded, and you're ready to build.

**Do not use when:** Aim is unclear (`/aim`), still exploring (`/solution-space`), or problem is ambiguous (`/problem-space`, `/problem-statement`).

## The Execute Process

### Step 1: Pre-flight Check

Before writing code, verify alignment:

```
Pre-flight Checklist:
[ ] Aim is clear - what outcome am I producing?
[ ] Constraints known - what must I NOT break?
[ ] Context loaded - do I have the codebase understanding I need?
[ ] Scope bounded - what am I specifically doing (and NOT doing)?
[ ] Success criteria - how will I know when I'm done?
[ ] Readiness clear - why am I deepening now, what invalidates this direction, and what should trigger a stop/pivot?
```

If any box can't be checked, stop and address it first.

If the work involves a one-way or hard-to-reverse decision and `/dissent` has not been run, flag it now. Cheap exploration before commitment is the point of the workflow; skipping challenge before a one-way door is the most expensive version of saving time.

Make the phase shift explicit:

 > "The task is [task]. The aim is [aim]. This ladders back to [selected approach or parent objective]. I'm specifically doing [scope]. I will NOT be touching [out of scope]. Success looks like [criteria]. I'm ready to deepen because [reason]. This direction is invalidated if [condition]. I will stop or pivot if [trigger]."

Those declared success criteria become the delivery contract for later phases: `/ship` should be able to verify what was promised, not just whether something deployed.

### Step 2: Build

Do the work. Keep it focused.

- Work in small, testable increments
- Stay within declared scope
- If scope expands, pause and reassess (see Drift Detection)

**During build:**
1. Make the change
2. Verify it works (tests, manual check, whatever's appropriate)
3. Run review if available (`sg review` or equivalent)
4. Handle review findings (fix trivial, create tasks for non-trivial)
5. Commit with clear message

### Step 3: Detect Drift

Periodically check alignment:

**Drift signals:** scope expanding, touching unplanned files, "while I'm here" thoughts, approach reversing direction, protecting sunk-cost code.

**When you notice drift:**

```
Drift Check:
- Original aim: [aim]
- What I'm doing now: [current work]
- Gap: [describe the divergence]
- Verdict: [aligned | minor drift | significant drift | lost]
```

**Aligned:** Continue. **Minor drift:** Note it, refocus if needed. **Significant drift:** Pause — refocus, get confirmation, or salvage. **Lost:** Invoke `/salvage` immediately.

### Step 4: Salvage if Needed

When to stop: approach has reversed 3+ times, scope keeps expanding, you're oscillating not converging, the finish line keeps moving.

Don't fight lost work. Extract the learning and restart clean. Invoke `/salvage`.

## Output Format

When execution completes successfully:

```
## Execution Complete

**Task:** [what was done]
**Aim achieved:** [how it maps to the original aim]

### Declared Success Criteria
- [criterion 1]
- [criterion 2]

### Delivered Characteristics
- [characteristic/result]: [met | partially met | deferred]

### Changes
- [file/component]: [what changed and why]

### Verification
- [how it was tested/verified]

### Needs Human Verification
Claims that the model asserted but cannot independently confirm:
- [characteristic that was claimed met but not externally observed]
- [assumption that was carried forward without independent test]

If this section is empty, say why.

### Notes
- [anything relevant for future work]
```

When drift triggers a pause:

```
## Execution Paused - Drift Detected

**Original aim:** [aim]
**Current state:** [where things stand]
**Drift:** [what diverged and why]

### Options
1. [option 1]
2. [option 2]
3. Salvage and restart

Recommendation: [your assessment]
```

## Session Persistence

**Reads:** Aim, Problem Statement, Solution Space — essential for drift detection.

**Writes:** Execute status with declared success criteria and delivered characteristics:

```markdown
## Execute
**Updated:** <timestamp>
**Status:** [pre-flight | in-progress | drift-detected | complete]

[execution notes, declared criteria, delivered characteristics, drift observations]
```

## Position in Framework

**Comes after:** `/solution-space` (you need a chosen approach to execute).
**Leads to:** `/ship` to deliver, `/review` to verify, `/salvage` if drifting.
**Can loop back to:** `/aim` or `/problem-space` via `/salvage` when the approach isn't working.
