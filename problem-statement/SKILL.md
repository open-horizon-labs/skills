# /problem-statement

Define the framing. **Change the statement, change the solution space.**

A problem statement is not the problem — it's the lens. Different framings open different solution spaces. The right framing makes good solutions obvious; the wrong framing makes them invisible.

## When to Use

- **Starting new work** — before solutions, articulate what you're solving
- **Solutions feel off** — proposed solutions seem convoluted or like workarounds
- **Oscillating on approach** — direction keeps changing; framing might be wrong
- **Suspected X-Y problem** — someone asks for a specific solution but underlying need is unclear
- **Requirements expanding** — scope creep signals framing mismatch
- **After `/aim` but before `/solution-space`** — aim defines outcome, problem statement frames challenge

**Skip when:** You have a crisp problem statement. Move to `/solution-space`.

## The Framing Process

### Step 1: Surface the Current Framing

> "The problem is currently framed as: [how it's being described]"

Capture: the stated problem, embedded assumptions, what's treated as fixed vs. changeable.

### Step 2: Detect X-Y Problems

Watch for X-Y pattern: someone asks for Y (attempted solution) when they need X (real problem).

**Signs of X-Y mismatch:**
- Request oddly specific for a simple goal
- Solution feels like a workaround
- "How do I do [technique]?" without explaining why
- Convoluted multi-step approach to something simple

**If detected:**
> "You're asking for [Y], but the underlying need seems to be [X]. Is that right?"

### Step 3: Separate WHAT from HOW

A good problem statement articulates WHAT needs to change, not HOW.

| Wrong (solution) | Right (problem) |
|---|---|
| "Add a caching layer to reduce latency" | "Page loads take 3+ seconds; users abandon before content appears" |
| "Refactor the auth module" | "Adding a new auth provider takes 2 weeks and touches 6 files" |

**Test:** Does it describe a symptom or a solution? Could someone unfamiliar with the codebase understand what's wrong? Does it leave room for multiple approaches?

### Step 4: Identify Constraints and Flexibility

**Hard** — regulatory, physics, existing user commitments.
**Soft** — "we've always done it this way," technical debt, team preferences.

Questions to surface flexibility:
- What would we do if [constraint] didn't exist?
- Who decided [constraint] was fixed? Can we revisit?
- Cost of violating vs. cost of keeping?

### Step 5: Craft the Problem Statement

**[Who] needs [what outcome] because [why it matters], but currently [what's blocking].**

Good statements are **crisp** (1-2 sentences), **outcome-focused**, **testable**, and **solution-agnostic**.

| Bad | Good |
|-----|------|
| "The API is slow" | "API responses take 800ms; our SLA requires 200ms" |
| "We need microservices" | "Deploying a fix requires coordinating 4 teams and takes 2 weeks" |
| "Users don't understand the UI" | "40% of support tickets are 'how do I X' where X is a core feature" |
| "We need better tests" | "Last 3 production incidents were caught by users, not tests" |

### Step 6: Validate the Framing

1. **State it to someone else** — if they immediately suggest a solution, framing is too narrow
2. **Invert it** — what would the world look like if this problem didn't exist?
3. **Zoom out** — is this a symptom of a larger problem?
4. **Zoom in** — is this multiple problems masquerading as one?

## Output Format

```
## Problem Statement

**Current framing:** [How the problem is currently being described]

**Reframed as:** [Your crisp problem statement]

**The shift:** [What changed in how we see it]

### Constraints
- **Hard:** [Actually immovable constraints]
- **Soft:** [Constraints that feel fixed but might be flexible]

### Assumptions Being Tested
- [assumption embedded in this framing]

Every framing rests on assumptions. If you listed zero, either the framing is trivial or you haven't surfaced what it depends on. Name at least one.

### What this framing enables
[What solution approaches become visible with this framing]

### What this framing excludes
[What approaches are off the table—and whether that's intentional]

### Signal This Framing Is Wrong
[What we would see if this framing is a symptom, not the problem]
```


## Session Persistence

**If session name provided** (`/problem-statement auth-refactor`): reads/writes `.oh/auth-refactor.md` directly.
**If no session name provided** (`/problem-statement`): offer to save with suggested name from git branch or problem topic.

**Reads:** existing session file; prior outputs — especially **Aim** — to ground the framing.
**Writes:** problem statement so solution-space can reuse framing, assumptions, and invalidation signal:

```markdown
## Problem Statement
**Updated:** <timestamp>

[problem statement content]
```

If the section exists, replace it. If not, append after Aim section.

## Position in Framework

**Comes after:** `/aim` and `/problem-space` (know where you're going and what terrain you're in).
**Leads to:** `/solution-space` to explore approaches, or `/dissent` if the framing feels too easy.
**Can loop back from:** `/solution-space` (if exploration reveals the problem is mis-framed).
